### 1. What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that stores, processes, and retrieves data, performing tasks based on instructions, known as programs. Computers vary widely, from simple calculators to powerful systems like supercomputers that drive advanced technology.

**Components of a Computer:**
- **Hardware:** The physical components (CPU, RAM, storage).
- **Software:** Programs and operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) that tell the hardware what to do.

**Types of Computers:**
- **Personal Computers:** Laptops and desktops for general use.
- **Servers:** Handle data processing and web hosting.
- **Embedded Systems:** Specialized computers found in appliances and vehicles.
- **Supercomputers:** Used for complex scientific calculations.

> **Example**: Your smartphone is a computer that combines hardware (processor, memory) and software (iOS, Android) to enable calling, browsing, and app usage.

### 2. How Computers Work

Computers work by processing instructions provided by software, executing them through hardware components. Hereâ€™s a simplified process:

1. **Input:** Receives data from input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
2. **Processing:** The CPU processes data based on program instructions.
   - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs calculations.
   - **Control Unit:** Directs operations within the computer.
3. **Storage:** Stores data temporarily (RAM) or permanently (SSD, hard drive).
4. **Output:** Displays results on output devices (e.g., monitor, printer).

> **Example**: When typing a letter, the computer processes each key press and displays the letter on the screen.

### 3. What is Computer Programming?

Computer programming is the process of writing instructions, known as code, that tell a computer how to perform tasks. Programming languages, like Python, Java, and C++, translate these instructions into actions the computer can execute.

**Example Code** (Java code to calculate the sum of two numbers):
```java
// Java code to add two numbers
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int sum = a + b;
        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
    }
}
