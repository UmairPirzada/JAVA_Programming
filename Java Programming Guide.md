## What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that processes data, performs calculations, and executes instructions to complete tasks. It consists of hardware and software components that work together to perform various functions.

## How Does a Computer Work?

A computer operates through the following basic processes:

1. **Input**: Data is entered into the computer via input devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
2. **Processing**: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) processes the input data according to the instructions provided by the software.
3. **Storage**: Data is stored in memory (RAM) for quick access and on storage devices (e.g., hard drives) for long-term storage.
4. **Output**: The processed data is output to devices such as monitors or printers.

## Basic Java Syntax

### Structure of a Java Program

```java
public class MyFirstProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is a comment
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // Print message to console
    }
}
```
### Key Elements
-Class Declaration: 

public class MyFirstProgram

- Main Method:
  
- public static void main(String[] args)
- Print Statement:
 System.out.println("Hello, World!");
