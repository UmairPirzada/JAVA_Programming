## Introduction

Conditional flow refers to controlling the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions. This is achieved using **comparison operators** and **logical operators**. These operators allow you to compare values and combine conditions to make decisions in your programs.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (`true` or `false`). Below are the most commonly used comparison operators in Java:

```text
| Operand 1  | Operand 2  | Operator | Description                                         | Result |
|------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| x = 1      | y = 1      | ==       | Checks if two values are equal                       | true   |
| x = 1      | y = 2      | !=       | Checks if two values are not equal                   | true   |
| x = 3      | y = 5      | <        | Checks if left value is less than right value        | true   |
| x = 6      | y = 5      | >        | Checks if left value is greater than right value     | true   |
| x = 4      | y = 4      | <=       | Checks if left value is less than or equal to right  | true   |
| x = 7      | y = 8      | >=       | Checks if left value is greater than or equal to right | false |
