# Tasks

## Task 1: Display Even Numbers from 1-20

**Functionality:** Display all even numbers between 1 and 20.

**Code:**
```java
Your Code goes here...
```
### Hint: 
**The program uses a for loop that iterates from 2 to 20, printing each even number.**

# Fibonacci Formula
- The **Fibonacci Series** is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This sequence is widely used in mathematics, computer science, and even appears in natural patterns.

## Definition

The Fibonacci sequence starts as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

### Fibonacci Formula
The formula to calculate the \( n \)-th term in the Fibonacci series is:
\[
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
\]
where:
- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)

### Explanation
Each term is the sum of the previous two terms:
- \( F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 \)
- \( F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 2 \)
- \( F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 3 \)
- and so on.


## Task 2:
- Display the First 8 Numbers of the Fibonacci Series
- Functionality: Display the first 8 numbers in the Fibonacci series.
**Code:**
```java
Your Code goes here...
```

### Hint: 
- This program calculates Fibonacci numbers by adding the previous two numbers in each loop iteration.

# Temperature Conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to Celsius)

This program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using the following formulas.

## Conversion Formulas

### Celsius to Fahrenheit
To convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
\[
째F = (째C \times \frac{9}{5}) + 32
\]

### Fahrenheit to Celsius
To convert a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius:
\[
째C = (째F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}
\]

## Task 3:
- Temperature Conversion (Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa)
- Functionality: Convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using command-line arguments.

**Code:**
```java
Your Code goes here...
```
### Hint: 
- This program takes temperature type and value as arguments, converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit using specified formulas.

## Task 4: 
- Calculate Factorial
- Functionality: Calculate the factorial of a user-provided number.

**Code:**
```java
Your Code goes here...
```
### Hint: 
- This program uses a loop to calculate the factorial by multiplying all integers from 1 up to the input number. It utilizes the Scanner class from java.util.

## Task 5: 
- Check if a String is a Palindrome
- Functionality: Check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

**Code:**
```java
Your Code goes here...
```
### Hint: 
- The program reverses the string using StringBuilder and compares it with the original string to check for a palindrome.
